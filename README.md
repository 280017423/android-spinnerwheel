This widget is based on [wheel widget][1] by Yuri Kanivets. See 'downloads' section for demo.

Original widget was rewritten a bit to have ICS-like look and feel and to support horizontal scrolling.
It should also to be a bit faster due to some optimizations.
Please watch out when specifying layout for items - they should have fixed size.
